        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Extended AnalysisTask's ability to figure out bisecting A/B tasks based on existing data points and test groups.
        Updated analysis page UI to show bisect button which will only appear when the middle commit set of the range in
        test group can be found.

        Finding middle commit set algorithm is described as follows:
        1. Find all commits from multiple repositories among the ranges specified by two commit sets in test group. In
        the meanwhile, merge all commits that have commit time into a single list. For commits only have commit order,
        put those commits into separate lists.
        2. Filter all the available commit sets in current analysis task by keeping the ones have exact repositories
        as the two commit sets in specified test group, and every commit of a commit set is in side the commit range.
        After filtering the commit sets, sort the remaining ones and only keep one commit set if multiple commit sets
        are equal to each other.
        3. Among commits processed by step 2, find the commit sets that have the commit which is closest to the middle of
        all commits that have commit time created from step 1.
        4. Among commits processed by step 3, find the commit sets that have the commit which is closest to the middle of
        commits that only have commit order and categorized by repository. We have to iterate through repository as commit
        order is not granted to be comparable between different repositories.
        5. If more than one commit sets are found, choose the middle commit set.

        * public/v3/commit-set-range-bisector.js: Added.
        (CommitSetRangeBisector.async.commitSetClosestToMiddleOfAllCommits): Instead of naively returning the middle of

        'run-test.py' will fail if 'node_modules' does not exist before running this script.
        Instead of calling 'os.chdir' to change directory, use 'cwd' in subprocess instead.

        * tools/run-tests.py: Added the logic to ensure 'node_modules' exists.
        Also use 'cwd' in subprocess.call instead of calling 'os.chdir' ahead.

        Extend 'ifBuilt' config key to set property based on whether certain repositories are built or not.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181906

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Before this change, 'ifBuilt' will always set specified property for test properties as long as there
        is a build type build in the same build request group. However, this is no longer valid as we don't
        want to set specified property for testing when only owned commit is built in previous build.
        'ifBuilt' needs to conditionally set property based on whether certain required repositories are built.
        Empty required repository list means no requirement on repository to set property.

        * tools/js/buildbot-syncer.js:
        (BuildbotSyncer.prototype._propertiesForBuildRequest):In the case of 'built', only set property when
        repository requirment is meet and there is a 'build' root request in the same build request group.
        (BuildbotSyncer._parseRepositoryGroup): Extend 'ifBuild' to pass information based on contition.
        * unit-tests/buildbot-syncer-tests.js: Added unit tests.

        Should reject updating a build request which has an associated build.

        Current code does not prevent submitting to same build request multiple times.
        This could lead to a build losing its associated build request.
        As a result, this build will be visible in charts which is not right.
        Added a check when a build request is reported.
        Addressed a 'FIXME' for the race condition inside ReportProcessor->resolve_build_id by surrounding
        it with a database transaction.

        Charts can be empty when values are all identical
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181828

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        Fixed the bug that when SampleVarianceUpperTriangularMatrix can store -Infinity as the initial cost
        of some entries when the sample standard deviation between two points turns out to be 0,
        and cause splitIntoSegmentsUntilGoodEnough to return undefiend because no segmentation has a finite cost.

        Also fixed the bug that the time series chart fails to show any data points when all data points have
        identical values as the entire y-coordinate gets collapsed to an empty value range by adjusting the max value
        when min & max values are identical.

        * public/v3/components/time-series-chart.js:
        (TimeSeriesChart.prototype._ensureValueRangeCache): Raise the max slightly when min & max are identical
        to avoid the chart becoming empty. Otherwise valueDiff in _computeVerticalRenderingMetrics becomes 0
