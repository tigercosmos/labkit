Test for PaymentRequest.abort() method

Click on each button in sequence from top to bottom without refreshing the page. No payment sheet will be shown, but the tests will run in the background.

Calling abort must not change the [[state]] until after "interactive".
Calling .abort() causes acceptPromise to reject and closes the request.
If you find a buggy test, please file a bug and tag one of the owners.

Harness Error (TIMEOUT), message = null

PASS Throws if the promise [[state]] is not "interactive"
